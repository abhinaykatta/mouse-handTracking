# mouse-handTracking
This project is about using hand gestures to generate mouse movements and clicks.
we have used openCV for hand detection, mediapipe library from google to detect the fingers and the distance between the fingers.
based on the number of fingers present and the distance between the fingers, the mouse is either moved or click is generated using AutoPy.

The current version can be used to generate mouse movement as well as double click.
The left click is yet to be added, in the future versions.
